#### We ❤️ Pull Requests

A pull request does not need to be a fix for a bug or implementing something new. Software can always be improved, legacy code removed and tests are always welcome!

After you make a code change, to run:

* Lint: npm run lint
* Test: npm run test
* Test coverage: npm run coveralls
* Build: npm run build

Please do not be afraid of contributing code, make sure it follows these rules:

* Build should pass, does not break any of the existing code in the master branch and does not cause conflicts,
* Comments are needed for confusing parts of your code only,
* An overview or context is provided as body of the Pull Request. It does not need to be too extensive.
* Tests should cover the your code, and overall test coverage should be above 90%
